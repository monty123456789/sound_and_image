Vector Abstractions Project 1

I love the spiral, the never ending, constantly moving falling void. Without beginning or end it's infinity is terrifying. 

Bridget Riley's 'Blaze' (https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-blaze-p05083) was a large inspiration for my vector abstraction piece. I wanted to emmulate the hypnotic ripples that seem to have no end. 

Making the spiral was suprisingly easy, using Push and Pull Matrix's I was able to create two spirals that enabled the two tone approach necessary to create the lines. The difficult part was making judgements about the colors, size, direction, fill, stroke, complexity. The options seemed as limitless as the spiral itself. Every variable could be adjusted and tinkered in relation to every other adjustable factor in the sketch, each time producing new and exciting results. Some of these experimentations can be found in the 'examples' folder in the 'vectors' folder. 

The final spiral I settled on is one of the simplest. During my experimentation I largely forgot about Riley's work in order to find for myself what worked best, often finding myself drawn towards the more complicated patterns. However, on coming back to Riley's work, and comparing it with my own, I realised that often simplicity is the most effective approach. By sticking to single hardlines, the shape and movement of the spiral is emphasised and the feeling of the sickening void impossible to ignore. This final spiral can be seen in the 'vectors_project1' folder in the processing sketch.
