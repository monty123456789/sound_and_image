To make this project I started with a simple following agent. By using the formula to establish an objects desired location, the following agent could be led by the mouse, constantly attempting to reach its location. 

Next I made a function that caused the vehicles to move in random directions when they hit the edge of the screen, meaning the vehicles always stayed within the screen. 

Then, by adding code that caused the vehicles to only follow the mouse when within 100 pixels, I was able to make them only follow the mouse if they were close enough. 

After this, another function was added that made them move away when the mouse was clicked, and a further funciton that changed the color of the vehicle depending on their state.
